    <p>Environ-mental is a group of students who have been waiting for a chance. A chance to voice out our feelings on what is currently happening to our environment. Everyday our environment is being polluted in different ways. </p>

    <p>Our advocacy group just started early 2017,  but with the help of people who are willing to support our group then we will achieve our goal to bring out our voice and to protect the environment for further destruction from pollution.</p>
