Other people dont think before cutting down trees; they just hold their chainsaw or 
any other equipment, and find the perfect tree for the greedy use and
start to cut it down to the ground. 
They do not know that our world would become a polluted one 
without trees. They don't think that the trees that they cut might be
a home to small animals, and that we also need them, the trees, 
for an oxygen to survive.

We as an advocate and fighters for nature condemn people for cutting so many
trees.

Deforestation is now becoming as the main environmental problems or issue. 
What is a deforestation?
According to IndiaCelebrating.com, "Deforestation is the removal of forests on a big level by cutting down plants or 
burning of forests for fulfilling the personal needs. 
Deforestation lead to increasing air pollution, increasing level of poisonous gases in 
the environment, increasing soil and water pollution, increasing environmental heat, 
and many more. All the negative effects of deforestation cause many health disorders 
and most importantly lungs and respiratory problems".

We should unite altogether to stop deforestation.
Saving forests, mountains, etc is in our hand and a simple help
from us may show a relevant result versus deforestation.
