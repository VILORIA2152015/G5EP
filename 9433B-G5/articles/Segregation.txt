Have you given thought about the garbages or wastes that is thrown in our houses everyday? Where will it go?
What it is going to happen after is is dumped? Does it have an effects on people?
Maybe you realize  that it get loaded on municipal trucks then it will be thrown or dumped on landfills somewhere.
But, I bet that most of us rarely bother about it.

Today, segregation is one of the biggest challenged faced by urban or metropolitan cities around the world.

Is segregation important? It is important because it is the most important step for waste management.
Wastes are segregated as Biodegradable or Wet wastes and Non-biodegradable or dry wastes.

Biodegradable wastes can be dumped in land for composting while nonbio wastes can be reused and recycled.

The table below shows us the easy way of recognizing the category of a household garbage.

Bio wastes			Nonbio wastes
Kitchen waste			Plastic bags, polythene covers, wrappers
Rotten fruits and vegetables	Metal items, tin cans, foils, sheets, scraps, etc
Paper bags & Newspapers		Tetra pack
Cotton clothes and rags		Glass bottles, bulbs, window panes, etc.
Thin sheets or pieces of wood	Synthetic cloth fabric
Cardboard			E-waste such as batteries, CDs, toys, etc


We all should practice segregating our garbages. This can be done by having two
dustbins at home. This bins can be labeled in different color or marked in writing
as Biodegradable and Nonbiodegradable.

Now its time to separate our trash! Lets make this world great again.
