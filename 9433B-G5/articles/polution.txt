According to NationalGeographic, "Smog hanging over cities is the most familiar and obvious form of air pollution. 
But there are different kinds of pollution—some visible, some invisible—that 
contribute to global warming. Generally any substance that people introduce 
into the atmosphere that has damaging effects on living things and the environment 
is considered air pollution".

cars, avoiding garden bonfires, never burn household wastes, using organic materials, limit using chemicals,

On a larger aspect, government of different countries are taking measures 
to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
