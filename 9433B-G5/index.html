		<p class="descriptions" id="seventhID"> &nbsp; &nbsp; Nature is one of the most important part of God's creation. Vegetables are planted, so that we can eat it to live.
	It gives us nutrients that helps our body to become fit and well. Trees also has a major role in our daily lives, it helps 
	us breath clean air. Trees also help in making the soil more compact because, it roots absorbs water if it rains , so that the soil 
	will not erode. Nature is used for decoration because, it is pleasing to the eyes.</p>

	ones that destroys them the most. Some people always throw plastics everywhere without even knowing what the consequences are. Some people also
	cut trees so much, so that they can build their house, to have bigger land and even make other products. Smoking can also harm the environment and health 
	condition of the human body.</p>

	that holds the soil together. Smoking can cause air pollution that leads other people to have health problems. It can also lead to climate change
	which causes strong stroms that can destroy houses.</p>

	<h3 class="title" id="twentiethID">Segregation for our nation</h3>
	<p>	&nbsp; &nbsp; Have you given thought about the garbages or wastes that is thrown in our houses everyday? Where will it go?
		What it is going to happen after is is dumped? Does it have an effects on people?
		Maybe you realize  that it get loaded on municipal trucks then it will be thrown or dumped on landfills somewhere.
		But, I bet that most of us rarely bother about it.

		Today, segregation is one of the biggest challenged faced by urban or metropolitan cities around the world.

		Is segregation important? It is important because it is the most important step for waste management.
		Wastes are segregated as Biodegradable or Wet wastes and Non-biodegradable or dry wastes.
	
		Biodegradable wastes can be dumped in land for composting while nonbio wastes can be reused and recycled.

		SOme examples of Biodegradable garbages are Kitchen waste, Rotten fruits and vegetables, 
		Paper bags, Newspapers, Cotton clothes and rags, Thin sheets or pieces of wood, Cardboard, etc. 

		While samples for Nonbiodegradable garbages are Plastic bags, polythene covers, wrappers,
		Metal items, tin cans, foils, sheets, scraps, Tetra pack, Glass bottles, bulbs, window panes, 
		Synthetic cloth fabric, E-waste such as batteries, CDs, toys, etc. 


		We all should practice segregating our garbages. This can be done by having two
		dustbins at home. This bins can be labeled in different color or marked in writing
		as Biodegradable and Nonbiodegradable.

		Now its time to separate our trash! Lets make this world great again.

    <h3 class="title" id="twentythirdID">Preventing Pollution is the Solution</h3>    
	<p>	&nbsp; &nbsp; According to NationalGeographic, "Smog hanging over cities is the most familiar and obvious form of air pollution. 
		But there are different kinds of pollution—some visible, some invisible—that 
		contribute to global warming. Generally any substance that people introduce 
		into the atmosphere that has damaging effects on living things and the environment 
		is considered air pollution".

		What can I do to help reduce air pollution?
		Simple things can really really help in reducing air pollution like saving energy, saving water, limit using
		cars, avoiding garden bonfires, never burn household wastes, using organic materials, limit using chemicals, 
		use water-based paints and glue, dont smoke and reduce, reuse, recycle.

		On a larger aspect, government of different countries are taking measures 
		to limit emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

		Lets help each other and make this world green again.

    <h3 class="title" id="twentysixthID">Killing Trees Can Kill You</h3>    
	<p>	&nbsp; &nbsp; Other people dont think before cutting down trees; they just hold their chainsaw or 
		any other equipment, and find the perfect tree for the greedy use and
		start to cut it down to the ground. 
		They do not know that our world would become a polluted one 
		without trees. They don't think that the trees that they cut might be
		a home to small animals, and that we also need them, the trees, 
		for an oxygen to survive.

		We as an advocate and fighters for nature condemn people for cutting so many
		trees.

		Deforestation is now becoming as the main environmental problems or issue. 
		What is a deforestation?
		According to IndiaCelebrating.com, "Deforestation is the removal of forests on a big level by cutting down plants or 
		burning of forests for fulfilling the personal needs. 
		Deforestation lead to increasing air pollution, increasing level of poisonous gases in 
		the environment, increasing soil and water pollution, increasing environmental heat, 
		and many more. All the negative effects of deforestation cause many health disorders 
		and most importantly lungs and respiratory problems".

		We should unite altogether to stop deforestation.
		Saving forests, mountains, etc is in our hand and a simple help
		from us may show a relevant result versus deforestation.
